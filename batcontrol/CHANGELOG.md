# Version 0.4.1-1 published on 31.03.2024
- bump to latest batcontrol https://github.com/muexxl/batcontrol/commit/128729e811a9cb2080257ea465b1b7a47d81c8cc
- changes in config - ATTENTION: no migration! Has to be done manually.

# Version 0.3.3-2 published on 15.02.2024
- bumo to last head of batcontrol
- including max_bat_discharge_rate for auto discover
- fixing pushing multi schedule to fronius
- CHARGE_MAX behaviour remains as before and is dependet by ``max_pv_charge_rate``
- DISCHARGE_MAX added and is newly dpendend by ``max_bat_discharge_rate``
- new config parameter for max discharge rate in mode 10
  - ~~changing the target schedule on fronius side from CHARGE_MAX to DISCHARGE_MAX when triggering "Discharge allowed"~~
  - value will be expected in Watts
- first check with DISCHARGE_MAX without config

# Version 0.3.3-1 published on 05.02.2024

### ðŸš€ MQTT Autodiscovery available!!

simply add below options to the config section mqtt to register batcontrol as a device in you HA

mqtt:
...

- auto_discover_enable: true
- auto_discover_topic: homeassistant

### âš¡ Enhancement of batcontrol algorithm: relative price difference

The parameter `min_price_difference_rel`is an enhancement to the internal calculation when it is worth to charge your battery.
The legacy parameter `min_price_difference` is used to determine if it is worth to charge the battery for later hours with STATIC offset on the current price.
`min_price_difference_rel` is used to determine if it is worth to charge the battery for later hours with RELATIVE offset on the current price.
The algorithm always takes the HIGHER value of both calculations.

ðŸ“Œ Example 1:

    min_price_difference = 0.05 EUR
    min_price_difference_rel = 0.1
    current price = 0.20 EUR

    min_price_difference would suggest to charge if the price later on that day is above 0.25 EUR (=0.20 + 0.05)
    min_price_difference_rel would suggest to charge if the price later on that day is above 0.22 EUR (=0.20 + 0.20 * 0.1)

    The algorithm takes the decision based on min_price_difference and will charge the battery if the price is above 0.25 EUR in the future

ðŸ“Œ Example 2:

    min_price_difference = 0.05 EUR
    min_price_difference_rel = 0.1
    current price = 0.80 EUR

    min_price_difference would suggest to charge if the price later on that day is above 0.85 EUR (=0.80 + 0.05)
    min_price_difference_rel would suggest to charge if the price later on that day is above 0.88 EUR (=0.80 + 0.80 * 0.1)

    The algorithm takes the decision based on min_price_difference and will charge the battery if the price is above 0.88 EUR in the future

# Version 0.3.3-hotfix1 published on 24.01.2025

!!! WARNING !!!

There has been a breaking change in the configuration file.
YOU NEED TO UPDATE YOUR CONFIGURATION in the evcc section

change below lines in the config to make it work again:

loadpoint_topic: evcc/loadpoints/1/charging

to

loadpoint_topic:

- evcc/loadpoints/1/charging

# Version 0.3.3 published on 23.01.2025

HA Addon specific changes:

- move logfile to /data/batcontrol.log to make it persistant
- added entryscript for container startup
- mount persistant addon config folder in /app/addon_config
- use load_profile.csv from addon config folder if file exists
- use batcontrol_config.yaml from addon config folder if file exists instead of configuration provided via the addon configuration
