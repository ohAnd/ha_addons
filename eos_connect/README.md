# EOS Connect

## Overview

![EOS connect Icon](icon.png) 

EOS Connect is an open-source tool for intelligent energy management and optimization. It acts as the orchestration layer between your energy hardware (inverters, batteries, PV forecasts) and external optimization engines. EOS Connect is an integration and control platform—not an optimizer. Optimization calculations are performed by external servers:
- [Akkudoktor EOS](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS)
- [EVopt](https://github.com/thecem/hassio-evopt)

EOS Connect fetches real-time and forecast data, processes it via your chosen optimizer, and controls devices to optimize your energy usage and costs.
